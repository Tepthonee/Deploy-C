Simple project, I think

This is the source code for the project [jmthon.deno.dev](jmthon.deno.dev)
The project creates a session code for telegram user bot

The project was divided into branches


- **[go](https://github.com/MOA-YAD/0/tree/go)**: interface of colab
- **[telethon](https://github.com/MOA-YAD/0/blob/telethon)**: Telethon library and extraction code
- **[pyrogram](https://github.com/MOA-YAD/0/tree/pyrogram)**: pyrogram library and extraction code
- **[tgapp](https://github.com/MOA-YAD/0/tree/tgapp)**: Code to extract App-id and api-hash
- ---
- **[jmthon_test](https://github.com/MOA-YAD/0/tree/jmthon_test)**: Just a copy of the jmthon Userbot project
- It works inside the colab for two hours and then stops Project under development and incomplete
- **[lib](https://github.com/MOA-YAD/0/tree/lib)**: The library of jmthon Test It is stored in a file lib.zip
- You need to delete some files because they conflict with the library in colab
- It is placed in a file because it is faster than using pip for each library
